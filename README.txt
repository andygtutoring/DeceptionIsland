This game is in a Game-Jam theme that Meta.AI suggested to me.
"Unreliable Narrator": Develop a game where the narrator's information is questionable or misleading.

Meta.AI created an idea and started writing the code for me.
I asked: "Make a game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that is mobile friendly (no keyboard needed), and works in portrait-mode. The game can be any theme, any genre, but it must incorporate situations where the narrator's information is questionable or misleading. This could be through true and false rumors, intentionally lying NPCs, or red herrings, or anything else where the narratorâ€™s knowledge or info is sometimes unreliable."

Meta.AI generated HTML, CSS, and JS code.
Meta.AI also gave this game description:

Game Concept: "Mysterious Island of Deception"
A mobile-friendly, portrait-mode game where players must navigate an island, solving puzzles and interacting with NPCs to uncover the truth behind a mysterious disappearance.
Game Structure
1. Storyline: Players take on the role of a detective searching for a missing anthropologist on a mysterious island. The anthropologist was researching ancient civilizations.
2. Gameplay: Players navigate through the island by tapping or swiping to move and interact with objects/NPCs.
3. Questionable Information: NPCs provide clues, rumors or misleading statements, making players question the narrator's reliability.

Additional Features
1. Implement swipe gestures for player movement using JavaScript touch events.
2. Enhance NPC dialogue with more complex storytelling, variable reliability and contextual responses.
3. Introduce item collection and puzzle-solving to uncover hidden truths.
4. Create day/night cycles and weather effects to immerse players.
5. Expand NPC interactions with mini-games or dialogue choices affecting story progression.
Advanced NPC Dialogue System
1. NPC Types: Define different NPC personalities (e.g., truthful, deceitful, neutral).
2. Information Reliability: Assign truth values to NPC statements.
3. Contextual Responses: NPCs react differently based on player actions and progress.
4. Player Influence: Players' choices affect NPC behaviors and story branches.
Technical Enhancements
1. Canvas Optimization: Improve performance with canvas caching and layering.
2. Responsive Design: Ensure seamless gameplay across various mobile devices.
3. Sound Design: Add ambient sounds, NPC voices and sound effects.
Future Development
1. Multiplayer: Introduce cooperative gameplay for joint investigations.
2. Story Expansions: Add new mysteries, NPCs and locations.
3. Player Profiles: Save progress, track achievements and statistics.
To further enhance gameplay, consider integrating machine learning algorithms to adapt NPC behaviors and story dynamics based on player choices and progression.
